Topics:

1. General Design:
	 Sensing subsystem design decided upon:
		-Accelerometer
		-Magnetometer
		-Gyroscope
		-Barometer
		-Line voltage

	Micro-controller:
		-Have a low power mode
		-Communicate I2C method
		-Low sampling rate required 

		
	Power supply:
		-Draw power from the 6.6kV to charge a battery
		-The subsystems will draw power from the battery directly, battery charging status and levels to be monitored by micro-controller.

2. Write up:
	Each sub-team is to complete their respective sections of the write up.
	
	Subsections to be submitted by the 23rd of February at 14h00.

3. General acceptance tests:

	All to contribute to acceptance test section. Use a potential fault that the system is to detect and state the systems response to this.
